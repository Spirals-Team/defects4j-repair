This informal document presents the manual analysis of patches synthesized with automatic repair.

# [CHART-9](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#chart-9) Under specified

## Problem

The buggy method is a method used to update a range of a structure. If the end index of the interval is smaller than the start index, the interval was considered as correct

## Human patch

The human fix checks if the end index is smaller than the start index then the result is empty.

## Nopol patch

Nopol generates a patch which does not impact the passing test cases but 
disable a line for all failing test cases. Nopol manages to create a condition that match only the failing test cases that was possible because all failing test cases use a specific amount of data.

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [CHART 13](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#chart-13)

## Problem

The buggy statement contains an instantiation of a range which may contain a negative value.

## Human patch

The human patch checks the issue value if the value is negative, the program uses 0 instead of the negative value. 

## Nopol patch

The Nopol patch adds an always false precondition before the buggy method call.

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [CHART 17](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#chart-17)

## Problem

The clone method does not return a perfect clone of the current object.

## Human patch

The human patch uses the clone method of its parent and uses an utility class to copy the other specific data (a list of objects).

## Nopol patch

Nopol adds a precondition or change the condition before an exception. The precondition or the condition are false only for the failing test cases.

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [CHART 21](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#chart-21)

## Problem

Unknown

## Human patch

The human patch adds a precondition over a major part of the buggy method and create a new method which used to update data.

## Human patch

I don't understand the Nopol patch because the generated precondition is complex and the Nopol patch does not apply on the same file as human patch.

## Correctness

Probably incorrect

# [CHART 25](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#chart-25)

## Problem

The buggy method may throws NullPointerException.

## Human patch

The human patch adds tree not null checks.

## NopolPC patch

The precondition Nopol patch adds a precondition always false before the call of the buggy method

## NopolC patch

Unknown but does not change the same file as human patch.

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [LANG 44](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#lang-44)

## Human patch
The human patch adds a check at the beginning of the method which parses a String to a number (String to int, long, float or double). The string can end with a 'l' , 'f' or a 'd' in order to specify the expected type. If the string only contains the char 'l' which specifies the type 'long' the method returns 0 instead of throws an exception, the others types are already correctly handled.

The patch written by the developer throws an exception if the string contains only one char and this char is not a digit.

## NopolC patch
The patch generated by Nopol adds a precondition before the method call which parses the string to a long. The method is only executed when the length of the string is bigger than 1. If the condition is not respected the program continues and throws the expected exception.

## Correctness

Correct


# [LANG 46](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#lang-46)

The human patch adds a parameter to the method, this parameter (```escapeForwardSlash```) is used to determine if the method has to escape the forward slashes. The method has also an other parameter (```escapeSingleQuotes```) which is used to determine if the method has to escape simple quotes.

In the test cases, the action of escaping forward slashes is always correlated to the action of escaping simple quotes. 
The generated patches is thus a precondition before the line which escapes forward slashes with ```escapeSingleQuotes``` as condition.

## Correctness

Incorrect


# [LANG 51](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#lang-51)

The buggy method is an utility method which parse a string (no, on, yes, true, false) and returns a boolean. The method contains a switch on the length of the string to parse (```switch(str.length())```). If the string contains 3 characters (```case 3```), the method checks if the string begin with 'y' if this condition is not respected then the next case is executed. The human fix consists to add a ```return false``` after the if condition. Inside the condition the method compare the two others characters to 'e' and 's'.  

## NopolC patch
The generated patch replaces the condition by a condition that are always true in this context (```str != null```). With this patches, the method returns true for each string of 3 characters which ends by ```"es"```. None test is written to test this scenario.

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [LANG 55](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#lang-55)

## Problem

An assignment has to be done only in certain conditions.

## Human patch 

The human adds a precondition before the assignment.

## Nopol patch

Nopol generates a precondition before the buggy assignment. The generated precondition is equivalent to the human patch.

## Correctness

Correct

# [LANG 58](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#lang-58)

The buggy method which parses a string to a number throws an exception when one integer is followed by ```l```. The ```l``` is used to specify the expected type of the output (```l``` for long, ```f```: float, ```d```: double, none: integer).

## Human patch 

The human fixes the condition which invalidates the string ```1l```

## NopolPC patch

Precondition Nopol  adds an always false precondition before the exception.

## NopolC patch

Condition Nopol simplifies the condition, remove the buggy part, and relies on checks available in called methods.

## Correctness

NopolPC: Incorrect, NopolP: Correct



# [MATH 2](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-2)

## Problem

The bug is exposed through an failing assertion.

## Human patch 

The fix changes a mathematical formula from method ```getNumericalMean``` by including parenthesis for prioritizing the multiplication operation over a division.

## GenProg/Kali patch

GenProg and Kali fixes modify another method w.r.t. the human fix location.
The patch removes an assignment statement that modifies the variable called ```upper```. 
The output value of this method depends on this variable.
The removed statements modifies ```upper``` using in the right part of the assignment the output of the (buggy) method ```getNumericalMean```.
Removing the assignment means the result of the buggy method does not affect other statements.

## Correctness

Not correct.
The test cases is quite simple for determining whether the patch is correct or not.

# [MATH 8](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-8)
```Java
public T[] sample(int sampleSize) 
throws NotStrictlyPositiveException {
//## Human patch 

 
//public Object[] sample(int sampleSize) 
//throws NotStrictlyPositiveException { 
  if (sampleSize <= 0) {
    throw new NotStrictlyPositiveException([...]);
  }
  //Human patch 

 final Object[] out = new Object[sampleSize];
  final T[]out = 
  (T[]) Array.newInstance(singletons.get(0).getClass(), sampleSize);

  for (int i = 0; i < sampleSize; i++) {
    out[i] = sample();//The KALI FIX REMOVES THE LINE
  }
  return out;
}
```
Code snippet of Bug Math-8. The manually-written patch is shown in the ```Human FIX``` comment at Line 2 (change of method declaration) and line 6 (Change variable type. The Fix proposed by Kali consists on removing line 11. 
    
    
Bug M8 fails to create an array of random sample from the discrete distribution.
The method sample from class DiscreteDistribution<T> receives the number of random values to generate (sampleSize parameter), and it returns an array of type T\[\] with that number of random values.
For carry out this functionality, the method first declares a variable  array of type T\[\] (line Y) and instantiates its using function Array.newInstance(Class<\?> componentType, int length)
Then it assigns a sample  value  (obtained through method DiscreteDistribution.sample() to each array position(line X).

The bug occurs when 
a) the first element is of type T1, an sub-class of T (so, the array instance is of type T1), 
and 
b) one of the samples is an object which is of type T2, an sub-class of T, but not of type T1.

In the Human fix the developer changes  the array's type in its declaration (from T to Object) and the way the array is instantiated.
The patch generated by Kali removes the statement which assigns samples to the array (and that also throws the exception).
As consequence, the result of method sample is an empty array.
The patch produces that the failing test case now passes.
The reason of this is case has only one assertion: it asserts the array size is equal to 1. 
The patch is not correct due the test cases never assert the content of the array.


## Correctness

Not valid.

# [MATH 33](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-33)

## Problem

A if condition contains a method call which uses an incorrect parameter

## Human patch 

Change the incorrect parameter

## NopolC patch

replace the method call by a condition which match the data used in the test cases

## NopolPC patch

add a precondition before the if with a condition which matches the data used in the test cases

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [MATH 32](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-32)

## Problem

## Human patch 

Add a not null check

## NopolPC patch

Unknown

# [MATH 40](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-40)

## Problem

A loop  reaches the maximum number of iterations prefixed by the application.
When it happens, the application throws an exception.

## Human patch

The human fix modifies the right part of one variable's assignment. This variable is further used to exit the loop.

## GenProg patch

GenProg fix adds an assignment over another variable that also is used for breaking the loop execution.

## Correctness

I do not know, the modified code is extremely complex. but it seems invalid.

# [MATH 41](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-41)

## Problem

The stop condition and the start position of the for loop is not correct.

## Human patch 

Change the stop condition and the start position.

## NopolPC patch

Add a precondition before the buggy method call. The condition is based on the data used in the passing and failing tests. 

## NopolC patch

Change the condition just before the buggy method call. The condition is based on the data used in the passing and failing tests.

## Summary

The generated patches are dependent of the data used in the test cases.

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [MATH 42](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-42)

## Problem

A case is not managed when a value equals 0

## Human patch 

Manages the case when the value is equals to 0

## NopolPC patch

NopolPC adds a precondition before a return null in a method called by the buggy method. 

## Summary

Nopol generates a patch that uses variables which are not use in its direct context. The patch is probably incorrect.

## Correctness

Unknown but probably incorrect.

# [MATH 44](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-44)

## Problem


The bug is exposed through a failing assertion.

## Human patch 

Before a return statement of the method ```acceptStep``` (called inside loop block), 
the patch done by developers adds a method call that modifies the internal state of EventState instances.

## GenProg patch

Inside the mentioned ```acceptStep``` method, the fix changes a boolean field.
This changes forces the later execution of a code block similar to the human fix code (that is, it changes the internal state of instances) in later execution of ```acceptStep``` method (remember it is called inside a loop).

## Correctness

I do not know. I can be valid. The code is too complex.

# [MATH 49](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-49)

## Problem

An exception occurs by trying to modify one vector structure (implemented similar to a map) which, at the same time, it is iterated.
Inside the method for multiplying vectors, an instance of this structure vector is created for store the results of the multiplication, and it is preloaded with one of the vector of the multiplication.
For multiply vectors, the method  iterates the result vector, so, when it tries to set the result there, the mentioned exception is thrown. 

## Human patch 

It changes the iterator:  the fix does not iterate the result vector but the term vector of the  multiplication.

## GenProg/Kali patches

The fix proposed by GenProg and Kali removes one statement that increments a variable for counting the number of elements of the structure.
The iterator reads this variable to know whether the structure has changed while the iteration. If it changes, the iterator throws an exception.
As the fix removes the incrementation of this variable, the iterator does not realize that the structure receives modification and never throws that exception.

## Summary

The test case does not have any assertion.
So, it assures the not presence of the bug by a) invoking the failing method and b) waiting the exception does not occur. 
However, it does not assess the result of the vector multiplication.

## Correctness

Not valid.

# [MATH 50](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-50)

## Problem

## Human patch

Remove a complete if condition

## GenProg/Kali patch

Remove one statement (assignment) from a if condition (that one removed by the human patch).

## Summary

Both human and ASTOR patches are the same and correct. 
The test has assertions to validate them.

## Correctness

GenProg and Kali valid.

# [MATH 57](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-57)

## Problem

The multiplication of two integer may produce an integer overflow.

## Human patch

The human patch changes the type to double of the variable which contains the result of the multiplication.

## Nopol patch 

The Nopol patch changes the comportment of the ```equals``` method of an other class. With the patch, the method returns always true when the two objects are the same type and have the same length.

## Summary

The equals method is not tested

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [MATH 58](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-58)

## Problem

bad parameter in a method call

## Human patch

The human patch removes one parameter of the method call.

## Nopol patch 

The Nopol patch is to complex to be understood. 

The execution path:
test -> buggy method -> call parent class -> call on parent class of an attribute ( constructor parameter) -> call the parent class of the parent class-> call children class -> call the auto fixed method (240 LOC)

## Correctness

Probably incorrect

# [MATH 69](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-69)

## Problem

bad value in array assignment

## Human patch

The human patch changes the assignment value

## Summary

I don't see the link between the human fix method and the NopolPC fix method.

## Correctness

Unknown

# [MATH 70](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-70)

## Problem

The application throws a Null pointer exception.

## Human/GenProg patch

Both human and GenProg propose the same fix, that is, to replace a method invocation by a overloaded version.
The ```BisectionSolver``` has a field of type ```UnivariateRealFunction``` to operate inside the method ```solver```. 
The class has two constructors: one that receives an object of type ```UnivariateRealFunction``` (and setted in the mentioned field), another without this kind of argument. 
The method solver also is overloaded: one receives a UnivariateRealFunction, the other no.  
The field UnivariateRealFunction is null when the constructor without that argument was called.
The fixes proposed to use the UnivariateRealFunction received as parameter instead of the class field.

## Correctness

GenProg patch is valid.

# [MATH 73](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-73)

## Problem

An assertion failing exposes the bug. 
The test case waits for an exception when it calls the method ```solve``` with two arguments that represent a "bad inverval".

## Human patch 

It adds one if precondition before to check whether the arguments are invalid and, in that case, throws an exception.  
The precondition is added just before calling a overloaded version of ```solve``` method.

## GenProg patch

Replace the call to 'solve' method by an overloaded version.
The fix method call has less parameters and in its body it has  a similar precondition than the humans fix.
As consequence, the method called by the fix is who detects the invalid arguments.

## Correctness

Correct.

# [MATH 78](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-78)

## Problem

An assertion fails.

## Human/Kali/GenProg patch

Human, Kali and GenProg have different patches.

The human patch adds a if condition with a large code block inside method ```stepAccepted```.
There, it modifies tree fields and method's variables: ```ta```, ```ga```, and one field from object interpolator.

The GenProg patch adds an assignment statement in the same method (i.e., stepAccepted), in particular, some statements before the mentioned if added by developers.
the assignment modifies variable ```ta```.
The two assignments that modify ta in both human and GenProg patches has a similar right part: the expressions contain access variables to ```forward``` and ```convergence```.
Regarding to Kali, it removes one assignment from a method ```evaluateStep```, that is executed before the mentioned method ```stepAccepted```. 
This statements modifies variable ```t0``` which, then in  ```stepAccepted``` method, is assigned to 'ta'.


## Correctness


Human patch is larger than GenProg and Kali patches (+10 lines vs 1 line).
This patch includes some precondition for detecting illegal states.
The GenProg is somehow valid. For Kali, I do not know.

# [MATH 79](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-79)

## Problem

The arithmetic operations may produce integer overflow.

## Human patch

The human patch uses double instead of integer.

## Nopol patch

Nopol adds a precondition before the line which may produces an overflow. The precondition ignore all value smaller than -39 and bigger then 42.

## Correctness

Incorrect

# [MATH 80](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-80)

## Problem

Assertion failure.

## Human patch

The method ```flipIfWarranted``` flips an array as follows:
The array elements are grouped in rows, for instance, one row the first four elements, the second row the next 4 elements and so on.
The methods aims at flipping the elements inside a row.
The developers have changed the expression that represent the number of rows.

## GenProg patch

GenProg removes one of the assignments of the flip method.

## Kali patch

Kali removes most of the code for flipping.

## Nopol patch

The Nopol patch adds a precondition to avoid executing the flip code. This patch has the same effect than Kali's patch.  


## Correctness

Incorrect: GenProg patches is wrong due to it alternates the array.

I do not know: Kali and Nopol do not modify the array at all. That means is not necessary to flip the array w.r.t. the executed tests.

# [MATH 81](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-81)

## Problem

Array index out of bound exception.
The variable ```b2``` is modified with a value of an array element (The variable has a value before that assignment). The test cases exposes an illegal access.

## Human patch 

The developers updates the if conditions which block contains the mentioned assignment.
In the commit that includes the fix, the developer also includes other source code changes.

## Kali/GenProg patch

It removes the assignment statements.

## Nopol patch

Add a precondition to avoid executing the assignment.

## Summary

The test cases seems to not identify the slightly variability in the variable's values due to the assignment removement.

## Correctness

Generated patches are  not corrects. 

# [Math 82](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-82)

## Problem

One test case exposes the bug through a failing assertion.

The class SimpleTableaux has one field that is a double matrix (array of two dimensions).
The method ```doIteration``` accesses to this matrix. For that, it calls two methods for obtaining the row and column indexes, respectively.

## Human patch 
 
It consists on changing a if condition from >= to > into the method for retrieving the row index.

## Kali/GenProg/Nopol patch

GP, Kali and Nopol modifies the value of the column index. 

## Summary

The automated generated patched version and the human patches generate  different indexes, but by coincidence, the double matrix has the same value on those indexes.

## Correctness

The generated patches are not valid.

# [Math 84](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-84)

## Problem

A test cases has two cases that expose a bug:
In one, an assert fails, in the other, it receives an exception.
In both cases, a while reaches the maximum number of iterations allowed. 

## Human patch

Human patch adds a condition the end of the while block for exit from the while .

## GenProg patch

GenProg's fix adds a return statement at the end of the while block. 
As consequence, the while iterates only one.

## Correctness

Not valid.

# [Math 85](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-85)

## Problem

The test case receives an exception calling to a method.

## Human patch 

The developer changes an if condition by replacing the operator >= for >. The block of this condition throws the mentioned exception.
After the patch, given a set of input values defined in the test case, the if condition is never true, and the exception is never thrown.

## Nopol patch

Nopol changes the if condition. The patch includes one variable used in the buggy version (fa), and a new one (iterations). This patch is not correct. It has not logic to compare the output of one function with the number of iterations done by the algorithm.

## GenProg/Kali patch
Kali and GenProg patches remove the mentioned if and/or the statement that throws the exception. As consequence, after enter to the if block, the execution remains. 

## Summary

The Generated patches are corrected for the test input, but incorrect for other cases not specific in the test cases. The test case does not include a case for evaluating the detection of a CoverageException.

# [Math 95](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/blob/master/results/2015-august/readme.md#math-95)

A test case receives a IllegalArgumentException

## Human patch 

The developers modifies a method for always returning positive double values.
A negative value causes an leter Illegal exception.

## GenProg patch

GenProg replaces the return statement of the method by a ```return 0```.

## Summary

The test cases successfully assess the validity of the patched method.
The GenProg patch results (0.9750000000640364) is slightly different from the real patched result (0.9750000261341519), 
but the test case does not compare at a grade to detect those differences ```assertEquals(0.975, x, 1.0e-5);```
